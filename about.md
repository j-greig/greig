<strong>If you've ever asked yourself any of these questions...</strong>

“How can I make the leap to being a freelancer?”
“What should I do if my job doesn't rock my world any more?”
“How do I find customers, &amp; make them care about my business?”
or even:
“What am I doing? What is my purpose? What is my mission?”

You're in the right place.

## What others are saying
<blockquote>"Another author who is killing it lately with articles. Don't let the fact that he's a Brit dissuade you (ha), his is one of the few newsletters I actually enjoy reading."

<cite>— Mirtza</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Just started reading <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/reset-your-brain">your book</a> and loving it. I've had a tough few months and know I need to shake it up but there's always a "first I need to do X, Y, Z...what if my decision upsets someone..." getting in the way.

## My story
A few years ago <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2012/11/26/how-to-stop-being-a-graphic-designer">I had a personal meltdown and quit my job</a>, and then spent two months travelling across the USA by train. I was working so hard I didn't have energy for side projects of my own, and the work I was doing didn't feel like it mattered any more.

It seems naive now of course, but I thought that travelling would help me find clarity about my life purpose, and <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/10/the-unspoken-d-word-depression">shake me free of depression</a>.

When I got back though, the same old questions were waiting for me:
<ul>
 	<li>Who was I? (the real me, not the pretend person on the outside)</li>
 	<li>What did I want from life?</li>
</ul>

## Why do I write?
If you'd told me when I left school that one day I'd be spilling my guts out to strangers on the internet, I would have laughed. (<a href="http://greig.cc/journal/falling-off-the-edge-of-conversations">I can be pretty quiet sometimes</a>).

But after a decade in the design industry, writing—or thinking in public as I like to call it—seems to be helping me make sense of things.

I haven't found the answers to my original questions yet.

But I've made some important discoveries:
<ul>
 	<li>That it's <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2013/8/feeling-lost-relax-youre-probably-headed-in-the-right-direction">ok to feel lost</a> (and the people who seem to know what they're doing are often floundering too)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/1/i-never-finish-anyth">Fear of perfection</a> doesn't have to hold you back</li>
 	<li>Making yourself vulnerable allows people to connect with you</li>
</ul>
Whatever it is that you're feeling stuck with, I'm here to help you find your way.

I'm aware this is a longer-than-average page, so I'll stop typing now.

Thank you for being here,
