<h2>A concrete plan for making your website better.</h2>
Is your marketing website looking a little... neglected? Maybe the design or copy on your website isn’t right, but you can't quite put your finger on why? Or maybe you just need a fresh pair of eyes and an honest appraisal?

For 15 years I’ve worked with clients like Google, Topshop and Guggenheim to design and build websites — and I’d love to help improve your website too.

Whatever the problem might be, I can help you figure out what isn’t working about your current website, and how to fix it.
<h2>How Galvanise works</h2>
First we’ll spend 30 minutes on Skype reviewing your website (up to three key pages) and your business objectives.

Then I'll create a written report with at least 1,000 words of actionable advice on improving your website, with analysis of its design, copywriting and SEO.

Lastly, you’ll receive a list of at least twelve “no-brainers” — things you can change right away to improve your website, from the labels on buttons, to inconsistent design elements, to layout and content suggestions.
<h2>Ready to energise your website?</h2>
If you want an easy-to-follow, tailored report that will guide you to a better website, you’re in the right place.

<h2>About me</h2>
