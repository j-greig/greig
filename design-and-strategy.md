If you're not getting the results you want online, I can help...

<em>• Show your work (and build an engaged audience)</em>
<em>• Optimise the design &amp; copy for your sales/landing page
• Create a strong, professional image for your startup</em>

With over a decade's experience in graphic design, plus hands-on knowledge of writing, marketing and social media, I'm uniquely placed to create good-looking websites that deliver real results.

<h2>How you can work with me</h2>
<strong>Design/Thinking</strong>
<em>£300</em>
Get insightful, actionable advice on improving your website, app or service. We'll discuss your business objectives in depth, then I'll pick apart your design and content (up to 5 key pages from your site), and write a detailed 1,000+ word report on how to make things better.

<strong>Design/Single</strong>
<em>£600</em>
A redesign of a single page on your website, or the creation of a new one. After a brainstorming session, I'll create a design for you (delivered as a Photoshop file) and write a single-page report on extracting maximum juice from your new baby. If you don't have a web developer to build my design, I can advise on that too.

<strong>Design/Build</strong>
<em>from £4,000</em>
Need a new website? I'll design and build a custom Wordpress-powered website which is easy for you to update, and works beautifully on everything from a mobile phone to a tablet to a laptop.

<h2>I create websites which are simple, effective &amp; human</h2>
Or in other words, my speciality is making brands work on the web.

I'm not afraid to do things differently — which is why you won't find me on LinkedIn, and why I don't hold back from asking difficult questions.

For the past three years I've worked directly with my own clients, <a href="http://greig.cc/freelance-digital-designer-london">as well as freelanced at various studios here in London</a>.

When I said 'uniquely placed' earlier, here's what I meant. In addition to my design experience, I have hands-on experience of the essential elements of running a business online, including:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2015/4/dont-make-it-about-you-copywriting">Writing (and promoting) content</a></li>
 	<li>Building email lists</li>
 	<li>Selling products</li>
 	<li>Nurturing social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook and Twitter)</li>
 	<li>Optimising landing pages</li>
</ul>
Curious about how I got here?

I trained at Glasgow School of Art in Scotland, then worked for <em>Marque Creative</em> in Glasgow as a digital designer for five years, before moving to London to work at a studio called <em>Bureau for Visual Affairs</em> (who I consider to be among the very best in the business).

Along the way I created a popular lifestyle blog called <a href="http://www.cyclelove.cc/" target="_blank">CycleLove</a>, fell back in love with writing again, and fell off my bike a few times too.
