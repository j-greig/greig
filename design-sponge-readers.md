Hi there. My name is James Greig, and you're probably reading this because you saw my 24 Hours in London article on Design*Sponge.

[sc name="newsletter-inpage"]

Because I covered a lot of ground during my day out, I thought it would be handy to mark the places I visited on a map for you.

You should start at the green 'A' below, which is Borough Market :)

Because of the way that Google maps works, I couldn't include exact transport directions, but the blue lines will give you a good idea of the best routes to take.

(Remember to buy an Oyster Card when you arrive in London, which you can pay for nearly all public transport with).

If you are paying my hometown a visit, I hope you have a great trip, and please <a href="http://twitter.com/j_greig">say hi on Twitter</a> if you have any questions :)

Cheers,

—James
<h2 class="mt4">A little about me</h2>
Three years ago, I had one of those 'What the hell and I doing with my life moments?", and since then, things have never been the same.

I quit my job, went travelling across the USA by train, and started spilling my guts out on the internet. Pretty quickly I realised that other creative people were experiencing something similar, so I started collecting together their stories, and looking for common strands.

I've been collecting my findings <a href="http://greig.cc/">right here on my blog</a>, which covers everything from <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/10/the-unspoken-d-word-depression">my experience of depression</a>, to techniques <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/10/writing-1000-words-daily-accountability-hack">for writing more often</a>.

If you've ever asked yourself any of these questions...
<ul>
 	<li>“How can I make the leap to being a freelancer?”</li>
 	<li>“What should I do if my job doesn't rock my world any more?”</li>
 	<li>“How do I find customers, &amp; make them care about my business?”</li>
 	<li>“What am I doing? What is my purpose? What is my mission?”</li>
</ul>
You're in the right place!
