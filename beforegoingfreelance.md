If you're thinking about quitting your full-time job, you've probably been asking yourself some of these questions:

* Do I have enough experience yet?
* What if I put myself out there, and nothing happens?
* How do I figure out what rate to charge?
* I've got a mortgage to pay & kids on the horizon, is it too risky?
* Will freelancing make me happier, or will I just end up drowning in paperwork?
* Am I ready to make the jump?
 
I know what it feels like, because after 10 years working as a graphic designer, I was in exactly the same place as you. I'd lost my creative spark, and didn't seem to have the time (or energy) to pursue side projects any more.

Here's the good news...

With the correct mindset and planning, you can go freelance sooner than you think, and without "making the jump". 

Taking control of your working life—whilst still having time for side projects—is not a fanciful idea.

After 3 years of self-employment, I can't imagine ever having a boss again, and I want to help you experience the same freedom that I've found. So I've packed everything that I wish I knew at the start of my freelance career into a series of email lessons.

## About your instructor, James Greig

I've lived and worked in the UK as a graphic designer for 12 years, first at Marque Creative in Scotland, and more recently at Bureau for Visual Affairs in London.

Since I went freelance in 2012, I've worked on my own terms with clients like Topshop&nbsp;and the cycling brand Vulpine, and freelanced at scores of design studios as a digital designer.

Although I frequently earn more than double my old monthly salary from freelancing, the main perk for me isn't money — it's having more control over my life.

So alongside freelancing, I've spent 30% of my time on side projects like the urban cycling magazine <a href="http://www.cyclelove.net/">CycleLove</a>, and&nbsp;a series of experiments: writing 1,000 words a day for a month, living in a windmill, and riding Boris Bikes from London to Paris to name a few. &nbsp;(<a href="http://greig.cc/">Read my blog</a> to find out how it all went)

I'm also crazy about Chinese food, although I'm not sure what you can do with that information at this point in time :)

Here's the bottom line: Freelancing has changed my life for the better, and I'd like to help you explore the same possibility.
