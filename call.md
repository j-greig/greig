If you have questions about your design career, I can help you get unstuck.

(And when I don't have answers, I know how to pose questions that will help _you_ figure things out for yourself, which can sometimes be even better.)

Imagine having someone who has been in your shoes as a graphic designer, a freelancer, and a human being, that you can bounce ideas off.

Imagine having someone who can help get you moving when you're not sure where to turn next.

Imagine knowing what to do next with specific, actionable, personalised advice and answers to your most pressing questions.

I've worked as a graphic designer for almost two decades now — in boutique studios, at large agencies, and with my own clients — giving me broad, hands-on experience of how the design industry works. I've worked freelance, permalance, part-time and full-time, and negotiated pay-rises and sabbaticals along the way.
