## If you have questions about your design career, I can help you get unstuck.

(And when I don't have answers, I know how to pose questions that will help _you_ figure things out for yourself, which can sometimes be even better :)

Imagine having someone who has been in your shoes as a graphic designer, a freelancer, and a human being, that you can bounce ideas off.

Imagine having someone who can help get you moving when you're not sure where to turn next.

Imagine knowing what to do next with specific, actionable, personalised advice and answers to your most pressing questions.

I've worked as a graphic designer for almost two decades now — in boutique studios, at large agencies, and with my own clients — giving me deep, hands-on experience of how the design industry works.

Along the way I've worked freelance, permalance, part-time and full-time, and negotiated pay-rises and sabbaticals too.

## Have questions about how 1-to-1 calls work?

**What happens after I pay?**  
Once you submit your payment, you’ll receive a link to schedule an appointment in my calendar and I'll send you a pre-call questionnaire to complete.

**Are there any other costs?**  
No, there are no hidden fees or additional costs. I might suggest investing in some software or a book that will help you, but that's it.

**I’m worried about sharing my personal/business details…**  
You don't need to be - everything discussed on our call is held in the strictest confidence.

**Do you offer refunds?**  
No, refunds are not offered for calls.

**I have another question!**  
No problem. Email james@greig.cc and I'll get straight back to you.
