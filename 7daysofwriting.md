So you’re struggling to make time in your day for writing.

Then when you do finally do sit down to write, you don’t know what to write about.

And the whole time you’re wondering “What’s the point in writing if nobody will read it?”

Here's the thing... there’s only one way to find out if you have something to say… and that’s to start.

(I call this “the writing paradox", and yes, it sucks).

But I promise you this… you have an unlimited source of things you *could* write about, safely tucked up inside your head.

You just need a helping hand to unblock yourself.

## Become a writer for one week. (And then keep writing…)

What if you could flick a switch and become a writer?

With no excuses not to write, and nothing stopping the words from getting out. 

If you need help choosing topics, making time to write, or just getting over your fear of starting, you're in the right place.

No more excuses. No more overthinking. No more quitting.

It's time to stop being a victim of the “Busy trap”, and start writing.

## What you’ll get from the 7 Days of Writing course:
1. A different writing prompt in your inbox every morning for a week
2. Myself and your fellow _7 Days of Writing_ classmates cheering you on to write, even when you don’t feel like it.
3. Daily feedback on your writing (optional extra).

## Want to know the secret about writing?

Well... here's the thing.

There is no secret to writing well.

Just a little hard work.

So the only question that remains is this… are you ready to write?
