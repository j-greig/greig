<p>I've been working on an article about creative burnout — but have realised that it's hard to write such a thing whilst you're still feeling burnt out. What a delicious irony.</p>
<p>But I thought I'd write down my findings thus far...</p>
<h2 id="it-s-easy-to-recognise-the-symptoms-of-creative-burnout-">It's easy to recognise the symptoms of creative burnout.</h2>
<p>You feel completely drained. Perhaps to the point where even the thought of making a change is overwhelming. You're cranky, uninspired, and generally not much fun to be around.</p>
<h2 id="there-are-many-different-causes-of-burnout-">There are many different causes of burnout.</h2>
<p>Here are just some of the feelings you might have:</p>
<p>1) My career is meaningless… help!<br>2) I can’t get motivated<br>3) I’m just totally stressed out<br>4) Ugh, I keep getting sick, I need a proper break</p>
<h2 id="work-overload-is-the-easiest-part-of-burnout-to-deal-with">Work overload is the easiest part of burnout to deal with</h2>
<p>From the list above, it's #3 and #4 that I've been battling with this year. I spent a week in bed with flu earlier this month, and then another two weeks getting my strength back. </p>
<p>But these are the easiest causes of burnout to deal with in some ways... you "just" need to find a way to reduce your workload and look after yourself better.</p>
<p>(I've written "just" in recognition of the fact that not everyone has direct control over how much work is landing on their plate).</p>
<p>Sunshine and exercise help too. And sometimes just reframing your thoughts can make a huge difference too. (See "<a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/9/hate-being-a-graphic-designer">Your job is your escape route, not a trap</a>).</p>
<p>Questions #1 and #2 are much harder to make sense of.</p>
<p><strong>What does "meaningful" mean to you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What motivates you?</strong> (Not just to get out of bed in the morning, but to keep chiseling away at something for days, weeks, months until something beautiful appears out of the dust.)</p>
<p>And following on from these questions, an even harder question:</p>
<p><strong>If you could work for yourself, what work would you do?</strong></p>
<p>Ooooft.</p>
<p>These are huge, huge, HUGE questions.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I don't have any answers for you just yet.</p>
<p>Instead, I'd like to invite you to chew these topics over.</p>
<p>I'm working on a series of articles that will help you (and me!) get some clarity on the causes of burnout, and how to make things better again.</p>
<h2 id="a-question-for-you">A question for you</h2>
<p><strong>How has creative burnout has affected you, and how have you coped with it?
</strong><br>I'd love to hear your stories about burnout. <a href="/contact">Drop me a note here</a>.</p>

<p>(PS. Here's my plan: I've put my freelance work on hold for the next 2 months, and I've got a 3 week trip to Scotland planned so that I can recharge my batteries. And yes, I feel very lucky that I'm in a position to do this.)</p>
