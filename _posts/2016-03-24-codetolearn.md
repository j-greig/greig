<p>The whole “Should designers should learn to code?” thing is such a tired ole’ topic that I’ve been avoiding writing about it for months now.</p><p>It’s a shame, because learning how the web works should (damn it!) be a fun process for us designers and non-techy people.</p><p>In this article I'm going to tell you how I taught myself to build websites, and suggest some ways to—more easily than you think—learn some basic HTML and CSS.</p><p>First though, let’s rewind a few years.</p>
 
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Honestly, I'm shocked that in 2010 I'm still coming across 'web designers' who can't code their own designs.

<p>When this tweet was posted back in 2010, it launched a gazillion blog posts, each arguing the case why/why not designers should learn to code.</p><p>To cut a long story short: the answer to “Should designers learn to code?” is more nuanced than a simple “Yes” or “No”.</p><p>And actually, there’s a much better question, which you can easily figure out an answer to, right here and now.</p><h2>If you’ve been thinking about learning HTML and CSS</h2><p>Try this as your opening gambit instead…</p><p><strong>“What do I want to build?”</strong></p><p>Making this your starting point ensures that your expectations are realistic. And that you don’t get lost in a quagmire of horrendously complicated Bootstrap themes or JavaScript frameworks a couple of weeks from now. (Trust me, you don't wanna go there yet...)</p><p>To explain, let’s take a look at three possible answers to the question “What do I want to build?”…</p><p>(On which note, if there’s something else related to coding websites you’d like me to write about, <a href="http://greig.cc/contact">drop me a note</a>).</p><p><strong><em>”I want to build websites that I’ve designed for clients, instead of outsourcing them to a developer”</em></strong></p><p>Makes sense right, because developers are hella expensive to hire?</p><p>But, of course, there’s a reason for this… it takes a good few years to get your head around the complexities of web development.</p><p>Which means two things: (a) good developers are always in demand and (b) you won’t be coding any websites for your client in the immediate future. (Further down the line, by all means though).</p><p>Sorry to be a downer! But I want to keep this real. Real is good.</p><p>So let’s skip this answer for now, and move to something a bit less ambitious…</p><p><strong><em>”I want to put together a portfolio website for myself.”</em></strong></p><p>Ah, better. Much better. Once, you’ve picked up some basic HTML and CSS, this is a nice place to start. Plus it gives you something all of your own to tinker with.</p><p>(Just be wary of spending more time building your site than you do promoting yourself/your work — I’m actually using Squarespace for this website at the moment to sidestep this temptation).</p><p>However, building a portfolio website is still a chunky old topic, so it’s something I’ll need to explore in a longer article. (<a href="http://bitly.com/greignews">Sign up to my mailing list</a> to stay updated on this).</p><p>On to the next (imaginary) answer then…</p><p><strong><em>I just want to get a rough idea of how HTML and CSS works.</em></strong></p><p>Gooooood. Every designer needs this. Knowing <em>about</em> code is always going to be useful, as you’ll have a better idea of what can/can’t be built, plus find it easier to communicate with developers. (Or at the very least, to have an idea what they’re saying the next time you send them a PSD and there’s something in your design that’s freaking them out).</p><p>What if I told you that you can start poking around under the skin of the internet right now? Using tools you’ve already got?</p><p>Yup.</p><h2>"Code to learn" beats "Learn to code"</h2>

<p>When I taught myself to make websites back in 1998(ish), the web was a very different place.</p><p>No Google. No social media. No cat videos. And no snazzy online courses teaching you to code.</p><p>I taught myself the basics of making websites on one of those nasty beige PC boxes with a massive cube-like monitor, hooked up to the net via a dialup modem.</p><p>These days, there’s a whole heap of places you can learn HTML and CSS online.</p><p><strong>And the cool thing about web browsers these days (from Chrome to Firefox to Safari and even Internet Explorer) is that they’ve got something called "developer tools" built in.</strong></p><p>Firefox used to be the most popular browser for this, but these days it’s Chrome’s “Developer Tools” that have taken pole position.</p><p>Don't let the name fool you though.</p><p>Even if you’re not a developer, you can use Chrome’s Developer Tools—“DevTools” for short—to hack away at websites to your heart’s content.</p><ul><li><a href="http://greig.cc/devtools-what-the-font/">Ever wanted to know what font a headline is written in?</a></li><li>Or see what a web page would look like in a different font?</li><li><a href="http://greig.cc/devtools-download-image/">Ever wanted to grab an image from a website, but the usual right-click-to-download doesn’t work?</a></li><li>Ever wanted to change the colour behind something on a website so you can comp it into your mockup?</li><li><a href="http://greig.cc/devtools-reveal-hidden-password/">Ever wanted to reveal a <strong><em>******</em></strong> password that's saved in a form</a>, but you can't for the life of you remember?</li></ul><p>Well, DevTools can help you with all this stuff, and lots more.</p><p>It's easier than you think, and as you go, you'll pick up some HTML and CSS without really trying.</p><p>So, if you're game, I'm going to start teaching you some basic DevTools stuff in my next article.</p><p>(Sign up to my mailing list below and get it sent straight to your inbox).</p><p>Meanwhile, have a think about what you want to build... :)</p>
