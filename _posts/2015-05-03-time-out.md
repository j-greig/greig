<p>A confession: I've been battling demons recently.</p>

<p>Work seems to have taken over everything, which means that writing has taken over my weekends. (And worse than that, when I have sat down to write, not much has come out).</p>

<p>I suspect it is partly <a href="http://scottberkun.com/2015/my-creative-burnout/">creative burnout</a>, but I think the only way to know for sure is to press the pause button.</p>

<p>So—and with a healthy "You are not your work" mantra ringing in my ears—I'm taking a break from writing during May.</p>

<p>In the meantime, feel free to peruse <a href="http://greig.cc/?tag=popular">the most popular essays</a> on this site, and <a href="https://bitly.com/greigthink">browse my Google bookmarks</a> for a glimpse of what I'm thinking about. </p>

<p>Please know that your readership matters hugely to me, and that I'll be devoting some thinking time to how I can best serve you over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Thank you for tuning in... and talk soon,</p>

<p>James</p>
