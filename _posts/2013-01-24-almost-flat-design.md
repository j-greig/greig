<p>Matthew Moore<a href="http://www.matthewmooredesign.com/almost-flat-design/"> takes a rational look at the flat design trend</a>&nbsp;in relation to usability, gradients and&nbsp;drop-shadow. And doesn't mention 'skeumorphic' once, thankfully:</p><blockquote>Flat design is beautiful and refreshing. It’s also generally faster to design and easier to make responsive. If it was a graphic design trend, it’d be well received. Unfortunately, us web designers have that pesky ‘usability’ thing always looming large. We cannot ignore the user experience with our work, so because of that, flat design is inherently flawed.</blockquote><p></p>
