When I was a kid we'd make regular trips to the library during school holidays and I'd pick up a stack of new reading material each time. Sometimes I would get through six or seven books in a week, and although I have no idea what they were (other than every Hardy Boys adventure ever written, and a good chunk of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series), I've no doubt that reading expanded my mind in a way that no other medium can.&nbsp;

I'm glad of this, because reading as a kid is the first of author <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/09/19/zadie-smith-10-rules-of-writing/">Zadie Smith's 10 Rules for Writing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>When still a child, make sure you read a lot of books. Spend more time doing this than anything else.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<span>But somewhere along the line of adolescence I lost the reading bug — probably around the same time I quit playing the piano — and it wasn't until the past couple of years that it has come back again.</span>

How come? I'm not sure. Buying a Kindle (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CTUKFNQ?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3194&amp;creative=21330&amp;creativeASIN=B00CTUKFNQ&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=sneageek-21">the Paperwhite model</a>) has certainly made it easier to buy and read books. On the bus, on the tube, in the dark — places I didn't use to do much reading.

Beyond the change in technology, another contributing factor was having to update this blog. The more I've written the more I've felt like reading. Fuel to stoke the fire, I guess.

And on top of all that, I've also started reading in the early morning from time to time, as well as before I flick the light off at night.

So, here is what passed before my eyes in 2013.

It's not an exhaustive list, but it's as much as I can remember sitting here in the grey pre-dawn light on the last day of the year.

If you need a kick up the backside to help get your plans of the ground, read this book.

It had a huge painting of a pot-bellied man with a woman on his arm (based on the photo on the right) which put me off reading his books until now. Which was a huge mistake. If you only try one new author in 2014, make it this guy.&nbsp;

<strong>+ whatever paperbacks I read and didn't keep a note of.&nbsp;</strong>

<hr />

Looking back at this list, I'm definitely going to try and read more non-fiction in 2014 — it makes for much better bedtime reading, and has a habit of throwing up fresh perspectives on things, no matter how old the book in question is.

What were the best things you read this year?
