<p>I don't feel ready.</p>

<p>And if I'm honest, I feel a bit scared to be writing this.</p>

<p>But I know that there won't ever be <a href="http://greig.cc/you-will-never-be-ready">"a right time"</a> to try it. </p>

<p>And I know that being afraid is just an excuse.</p>

<p>One that isn't ever going to go away. </p>

<h2 id="whatamiafraidof">What am I afraid of?</h2>

<p>Whilst the tense feeling in my gut might seem real right now, I know it's an illusion.</p>

<p>I'm afraid of not making enough money to pay my rent — but I can always use my credit card if I need to.</p>

<p>I'm afraid of being judged... "What if people don't like my product?" — but letting these as yet imaginary haters stop me before I've started is ridiculous. </p>

<p><strong>So I'm setting myself a challenge this month: to pay my rent by writing, instead of graphic design.</strong></p>

<p>Which means I have 28 days to make £693.</p>

<p>If that sounds like a lot, yup, renting in London is expensive.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="howamigoingtodoit">How am I going to do it?</h2>

<p>I have a couple of paid guest blog posts due to be published in the next few weeks. (A first for me, so I'm excited!) There is also a small trickle of money coming in <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/reset-your-brain">from my first ebook</a>. But this alone isn't enough to make rent, even if I get another paid writing gig or two lined up.</p>

<p>So the plan is to create a new product, and have the finished version on sale at the end of March. As Amy How says in her guide to launching side projects: <a href="https://unicornfree.com/just-fucking-ship">"Just Fucking Ship"</a>.</p>

<p>The only question left to answer now is...</p>

<h2 id="whichsideproject">Which side project?</h2>

<p>I've been mulling over a few concepts already. Some of them for over a year in fact. So here's a quick rundown of each option, and the things it has going for it (or not).</p>

<p><strong>Idea A: a guide to using Instagram for small/creative businesses.</strong> If this sounds like something you'd like to read, please take a minute <a href="http://jamesgreig.typeform.com/to/xv64yS">to complete this short survey</a>).</p>

<p>Pros: </p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of research in place already</li>
<li>My own personal experience of building a large Instagram following (<a href="http://instagram.com/jamesgreig">@jamesgreig</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons: </p>

<ul>
<li>I need to do do a lot of interviews with brands to figure out what works for them on Instagram, so I have something to back up my own experience</li>
<li>Although I'm pretty clued up on the platform, I've only been using it for a few years, compared to over a decade's experience in the design industry.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Idea B: A freelance graphic designer's survival kit</strong> <br>
A couple of years ago, <a href="http://greig.cc/a-freelance-graphic-designers-survival-guide">I wrote a long list of tips for freelance designers</a>. The plan would be to expand on this, and include detailed information on things like setting up a portfolio website, finding work, and keeping your finances in order.</p>

<p>For: </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm already an expert on this (3 years of freelancing next month!)</li>
<li>Lots of contacts in place in my existing network</li>
<li>I already have several articles written on the subject, all of which <a href="https://twitter.com/heydesigner/status/375501577282678785">were </a><a href="https://twitter.com/adobeccdesign/status/385171548211924992">well </a><a href="http://greig.cc/a-freelance-graphic-designers-survival-guide">received </a> by designers and the design industry  </li>
<li>I know there is a need for this product, based on other people's questions, not just my own experience</li>
</ul>

<p>Against: </p>

<ul>
<li>Someone has recently launched a product with the same name. (Pah! I can think of a different one if I need to).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Idea C: An Aeropress Recipe Book</strong> <br>
This is something I've been talking about with my girlfriend for a while. We have an <a href="https://twitter.com/aeropressrecipe">@aeropressrecipe</a> account running on Twitter, but nothing else.</p>

<p>For: </p>

<ul>
<li>Seems like it would be fun</li>
<li>Um... I like coffee</li>
</ul>

<p>Against:</p>

<ul>
<li>No existing audience to sell the book to, other than Twitter</li>
<li>"Seems like it would be fun" is probably a red herring to divert me from the hard work involved in the other options</li>
<li>I've only had an Aeropress for a few months, so I don't actually know that much about this topic</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at the options, idea B seems like a clear winner to me.</p>

<p>It's something that I can tackle in 4 weeks. And I have an audience in place (both on Twitter, and more importantly, in my mailing list).</p>

<p>The other ideas could still be workable, but I'm going to come back to them next month I think...</p>

<h2 id="sowhatnext">So what next?</h2>

<p>As Nathan Barry said <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/24hours/">in his 24-hour product challenge</a>: "Want to build a following? The simplest way is to work in public. Just share what you’re building, why you made certain decisions, and the results from building it".</p>

<p>I'm sure that some stuff will go wrong, and there will be times I wished people weren't watching.</p>

<p>But my <a href="http://greig.cc/writing-1000-words-daily-accountability-hack">30 days of writing experiment</a> has already made the benefits of accountability clear to me. </p>

<p>So I'm going to document my progress on this blog as I go.</p>

<p>All of the numbers, plus my planning process, plus the stuff that's going on inside my head. You can even <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aLog4wEsnt6X4gGG3dQq5iR36pCqC2ZFDkvu_H6KSNw/edit?usp=sharing">track my daily earnings in this public Google doc</a> for a full breakdown of the numbers.</p>
