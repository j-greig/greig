<p><a href="http://jeffjlin.com/2013/02/23/ang-lee-and-the-uncertainty-of-success/">The story of director Ang Lee's six year struggle to make it in the movie business</a>&nbsp;serves as an inspirational reminder to any aspiring creative or startup founder of the importance of (a) hanging on in there (b) doing something that you love.</p><blockquote>Much is made of genius and talent, but the foundation of any life where you get to realize your ambitions is simply being able to out-last everyone through the tough, crappy times â€” whether through sheer determination, a strong support network, or simply a lack of options.</blockquote><p></p><p></p>
