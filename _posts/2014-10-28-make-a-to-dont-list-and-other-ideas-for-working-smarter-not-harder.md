<p>The more I've read about the habits of inanely productive people (mostly writers), the more convinced I've become that routine making maketh the man.</p><p>So this list of ways to prioritise, eliminate and optimise your tasks seems like gold to me:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Make a “to don’t” list.</strong>&nbsp;Another gem from the inimitable Tom Peters. Prepare a list that contains all the things you shouldn’t waste your time on – useless tasks, unnecessary meetings, worthless phone calls, and so on. Then place it next to your “to do” list – and stick to it.

<li><strong>Carry a notebook and pen.</strong>&nbsp;Thomas Edison did it. Virginia Woolf did it. And so did Charles Darwin. They toted a notebook with them everywhere and wrote down ideas that popped into their heads… Page through the notebook occasionally. Trust me: This is a fantastic way to spark ideas and to weave creativity into the fabric of your life.

<li><strong>Hone your elevator speech.</strong>&nbsp;Be able to explain who you are, what you do, and why someone could benefit from your unique talents – in 30 seconds. Then cut your pitch to 15 seconds. Practice it. Sharpen it… Caveat: An elevator speech shouldn’t<em>sound</em>&nbsp;like an elevator speech. It’s really an exercise in being honest, concise, and interesting.</li><li><strong>Establish an opening ritual.</strong>&nbsp;Try to begin your day the same way. If you work at home, maybe take a short walk before you go to your office. Have a cup of tea or read or meditate before starting your work. An opening ritual will ease your mind, body and soul into the day.

<li><strong>Establish a closing ritual.</strong>&nbsp;Know when to stop working. Try to end each work day the same way, too. Straighten up your desk. Back up your computer. Make a list of what you need to do tomorrow. (<em>More&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2011/10/how-can-you-stop-worrying-about-projects-at-w/">here</a>.</em>)</li>
