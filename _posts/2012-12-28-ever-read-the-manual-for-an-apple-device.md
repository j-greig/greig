<p>Me neither.</p><p>(On which note: the latest iPads are <a href="#">shipping without any&nbsp;instruction manual</a>, something which is probably not ideal for some new/older users)</p><p>But there is a crucial difference between&nbsp;minimalism&nbsp;and reductionism â€” one that is highlighted by the recent trend for gesture driven apps like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/" data-link-type="external">Clear</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.simplebots.co/" data-link-type="external">Rise</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://thisissolar.com/" data-link-type="external">Solar</a>:<span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>These apps have chosen to reduce details to achieve a minimal UI, but in the process the UI has also become harder to use.

A good rule of thumb is that the user should be able to figure out how to use an app just by looking at it.</em><br></p><p></p><p><a href="http://blog.maxrudberg.com/post/38958984259/if-you-see-a-ui-walkthrough-they-blew-it" data-link-type="external">If You See a UI Walkthrough, They Blew It</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/12/27/ui-walkthrough" data-link-type="external">Daring Fireball</a></p><p></p>
