When you know what your customer needs emotionally you can build something simple that fits those needs exactly.<br></em><em><br>When you understand what each UI element in your product means to your customer’s life, you’ll understand how to sell it better. What your product is and the way it is sold are completely symbiotic. And both depend on detailed understanding.<br></em><em><br>This realization is both simple and beautiful.</em></blockquote><p><em></em><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5021478" data-link-type="external">Join the discussion </a>on Hacker News.</p><p></p>
