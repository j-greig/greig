<p class="text-align-left">As a graphic design student in the early noughties, wrestling with the ethics of the profession after being exposed to the anti-consumerist sentiment of <a href="#">Adbusters</a>&nbsp;and the like, <a href="#">Howies</a> was one of the brands that I considered 'real'. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-left">Although the Howies founders Clare and David Hieatt have long since sold the company, out of the ashes rose <a href="#">Hiut Denim</a>. This time around their focus has narrowed to jeans, under the mantra "<a href="#">Do one thing well</a>":</p>

<blockquote class="text-align-center">We make jeans. That’s it. Nothing else. No distractions. Nothing to steal our focus. No kidding ourselves that we can be good at everything. No trying to conquer the whole world. We&nbsp;just do our best to conquer our bit of it. So each day we come in and make the best jeans we know how.</blockquote>

<p class="text-align-left">Just jeans? Well, not exactly, because this is not your average denim clothing. Made in the Welsh town of Cardigan &nbsp;by '<a href="#">Grand Masters</a>', expert jean-makers who have spent 20,000+ hours practising their craft. You can even trace the origins of each pair through something Hiut call a <a href="#">History Tag</a>, which enables the eventual owner to track the production of their jeans using a secret code.</p>

<p class="text-align-left">The Hiut yearbook reminds me of time spent pouring over Howies catalogues in their heyday — beautiful photography, illustration and storytelling, all softly-softly persuading you to invest in a pair of lovingly made jeans.</p>
