<p>In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, I became a news junkie, compulsively devouring two or even three news websites on a daily basis. It was an itch I could scratch, and for almost a decade was part of my online routine.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A daily side of news isn't going to kill you, but it's part of a larger problem, accurately described as <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/" data-link-type="external">The 'Busy' Trap</a> by author&nbsp;Tim Kreider — the &nbsp;cacophony&nbsp;of emails, messages,&nbsp;obligations, lists and scheduling which threaten to overwhelm us:</p><blockquote>"It’s not as if any of us wants to live like this; it’s something we collectively force one another to do."</blockquote><p>With these seemingly unavoidable mantras woven into the fabric of modern day life, it's no wonder that people talk of "not having time" to do the things that they want to. &nbsp;</p><p>But that statement is a&nbsp;misdemeanour in itself. &nbsp;You don't just "have" time — you <strong>make</strong> time.</p><p>Stop doing crap that doesn't matter, and do stuff that does.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Don't read or watch the news (Tim Ferriss calls this a "news fast" and recommends an initial diet of 10 days)</li><li>Don't read your email willy-nilly (I still struggle to avoid this.
