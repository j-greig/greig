Patrick McKenzie on why "<a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/05/31/can-i-get-your-email/" data-link-type="external">email is the best broadcast channel ever invented for business purposes</a>".

For anyone on the receiving end of too many emails (I know, I know... that's everyone), Swiss Miss has some <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/2011/03/communication-crisis.html" data-link-type="external">helpful tips from her users on handling communication overload</a>. And you should also have a gander at&nbsp;<a href="http://emailcharter.org/" data-link-type="external">The Email Charter</a>&nbsp;by TED curator&nbsp;<a href="http://tedchris.posterous.com/" data-link-type="external">Chris Anderson</a>.

Bonus: if you want to know what a great email&nbsp;auto-responder&nbsp;looks like, email the most popular blogger you can think of, and see what comes back.
