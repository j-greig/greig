Until a few weeks ago I had no idea that Matthew Inman — the man behind one of the biggest comics on the internet — was once a web designer.&nbsp;

His irreverent, often angry, sense of humour and "I could draw like that if I wanted" style has earned him cult status, and&nbsp;<a href="http://theoatmeal.com/">The Oatmeal</a>&nbsp;now gets millions of visitors a month, grossing around $500,000 in revenue in 2012 (75% from merchandising and 25% from advertising).

For an idea of why he quit his old profession take a look at "<a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell">Why a web design goes straight to hell</a>" which offers a few subtle clues about the dissatisfaction he felt with his old trade...

<pre><code>  &lt;img src="" alt=""/&gt;
</code></pre>

He left his web design job to start a dating website called Mingle2, but soon found that <a href="http://mingle2.com/blog/view/beards-cars-cats">the</a> <a href="http://www.biggerbetterbeards.org/">cartoons</a> he was creating to attract traffic were more popular than the site itself:

<em>The goal of it was kind of to build links, but it didn’t really work as an SEO tool. It just worked as a comic. People loved it. It got more traffic than anything I’d ever done, so that was when I kind of decided I clearly have some kind of knack for this sort of creative stuff and I think it’s a better fit for me than making little marketing gimmicks for SEO.</em>

All of which makes Matthew a perfect&nbsp;<a href="http://greig.cc/undesign/">unDesign</a>&nbsp;case study — if only he would respond to my emails.

So in the meantime, I've <a href="http://archive.today/1LFkm">scoured</a> <a href="http://mixergy.com/interviews/matthew-inman-oatmeal-interview/">the</a> <a href="http://moz.com/blog/my-departure-from-seomoz">internet</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/the-riffs-interview-12-secrets-of-insanely-viral-oatmeal-creator-matthew-inman/2011/03/11/ABM8JZR_blog.html">for</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://chicagoist.com/2011/03/16/wild_oats_an_interview_with_matthew.php">clues</a>&nbsp;and boiled down my findings into this bite-size list of blogging tips.</p>

<h2>1. Let your ideas for content germinate when they are ready, instead of forcing them</h2>

<span>According to an </span><a href="http://chicagoist.com/2011/03/16/wild_oats_an_interview_with_matthew.php">interview with The Chicagoist</a><span>, Matt uses a technique called "brain-farming" as part of his creative process:</span>

“I will come up with an idea that I want to write about, say unicorns or ctl+z, and then, I’ll think about it, and think about it. Now, when I sit down and think about it, I usually don’t come up with anything I can use, but if I go running or while I’m in the shower or something all the pieces just click together.”

Why does this work? Probably because <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2013/7/the-power-of-not-thinking">your brain works best when it's relaxed</a>.

<h2>2. Don't sell out</h2>

<span>"I got an offer from a deodorant company to write" something for their advertising, Inman says, noting that he turned down the product commission flat. "It's pretty much got to be a truly exceptional client. It it were Comedy Central, I'm all over that. Maybe if it [involves] an actor or actress I like. But Diet Coke, that's not gonna happen."</span>

<h2>3. Communities don't just happen, you need to build them</h2>

<span>"Building and hanging on to an audience is the biggest role of social media," Inman tells us. "Then every time I make a comic, I can broadcast it out to them. That's been really helpful. I have this audience waiting for me. It's been awesome. ... You need to be funny and continually make them laugh. But when I started, I also had this [casually inviting] tone: 'Hey, guys, I just made a new comic -- check it out!"&nbsp;</span>

<h2>4. SEO isn't important</h2>

<span>“A lot of people say: ‘How do you do it?’ I just make things that people like. SEO has no bearing on the Oatmeal — I did SEO in my old job [so I know] — but social media has played a gigantic part in what I do.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span>

Or to put it another way...&nbsp;

&nbsp;"<span>With The Oatmeal, I wanted to create something where the viral marketing itself was the product, rather than trying to put it on something else.”</span>

<h2><span>5. You never know what will resonate with people (So just keep making stuff...)</span></h2>

<span>"The reaction to a comic is usually the opposite of my expectation. There will be times where I will put in three hours of work on a comic and it will fall flat on its face, while one that took me an hour or two will blow up. You just never know."</span>

<h2><span>6. Utility and humour aren't mutually exclusive</span></h2>

Not everything on The Oatmeal is just for laughs. For example "<a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/facebook_likes">How to get more likes on Facebook</a>" is also packed full of great advice about so-called social media strategy.&nbsp;

Why does creating useful content matter?&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/affiliate-marketing-the-smart-way/">As Pat Flynn would put it</a>: "Your earnings are a byproduct of how helpful you can be to your audience".

Which brings me neatly to my last point. (Well it's Matthew's really...)

<h2>7.&nbsp;Put your energy into making things that are likeable, not into some douchey social media strategy</h2>

I'm not going to elaborate on this one. But you can refer to Jeremy Waites'&nbsp;<a href="#">80 Rules of Social Media</a> for more tips on this (prickly) subject.
