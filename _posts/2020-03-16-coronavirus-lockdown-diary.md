# If I come out of this with only one thing, it's going to be that I got my writing habit back.

## Day 2 — 17th March 2020

Went for a run at 7am even though I’m not feeling 100% at the moment.  Followed by a hot then cold shower. Ooooooft. I can stay in the cold water for at least a minute longer than when I started doing it. Can’t work out if I’m feeling  a bit off-colour, or just nauseous from watching and checking the news constantly.

It struck me that our country is run by someone pretending to be a blond idiot when it suits him, rather than an actual blond idiot, so that’s something.

Anyway, this is going to be a short entry because it’s been a long day (see start of yesterday’s update). Working from home was fine, although I instantly regretted having a visible mess in the background for video calls.  Not that I’ve tidied it up yet.

I’m glad I have job that hasn’t been instantly shut down. I’m glad I have a wee cat to keep me company. I’m glad I’m in a flat of my own with pretty much everything I could need.

Stay safe everyone.

## Day 1 — 16th March 2020

It’s 5am the morning after the UK government announced people should drastically reduce social contact because of Coronavirus Covid-19, and I have woken with a clear thought after a day of confusion: it is time to start writing again. I’m starting now because I don’t want to forget some of the things that happened yesterday.

I know that writing will help me make sense of what is going to be a crazy few months, and that one day I'll want to look back and read these posts, and maybe writing everything down will help me or someone else feel better.

One thing that’s not helping is the news — I can feel the anxiety ratcheting up as I watch, and it’s been hard to separate paranoid thoughts (“Is that sticky feeling in my throat the beginning of a dry cough?”) from reality. (“I am clearing my throat much more than usual”).  The rolling coverage is addictive, and I’m conscious that I need to wean myself off before it takes over.

When the news came out the first thing I did was call my parents, who were due to visit me from London this weekend. They’re in their late sixties, and in good health, but it’s hard not to feel concern about their health over anyone else in my family. We’d already spoken about a train not being the best place to spend time right now, so I’m glad the decision not to travel has been made for them officially now.

Yesterday at work the company plan was announced — “we don’t want you to work from home yet”. We had a sobering reminder of how the last recession impacted the economy, and there was talk of hours being cut. I pointed out that we had decided to follow government advice the previous week, but that I wasn’t sure any more that this could be trusted given the UK seemed to be on a different path from our neighbours in Europe.

The new government advice was announced right at the end of the working day, and I’ve not heard any updates from work since, but I’m assuming we’ll all be working from home now.  In any case, I made an early morning trip to Ikea on Sunday to buy a huge desk, as I had a feeling I’d need it sooner rather than later. So at least my home office setup is fairly decent, apart from the lack of a proper chair.

What else to say just now?

It looks like it’s going to be just me and the cat for a while. (I’m not too worried about being isolated just yet, as I’ve gotten pretty good at that living alone the past few years). I’ll tell you about our routine another day, but for now let’s just say it starts with me getting a lick and my paws chewed.
