<p><strong>Sometimes you have to say ‘fuck it’, and do something just for yourself, no matter what everyone else thinks.</strong></p>

<p>When I wrote ‘<a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2012/11/26/how-to-stop-being-a-graphic-designer">How to stop being a graphic designer</a>’ back in 2012, that was the kind of mood I was in.</p>

<p>After blogging—quite politely—on CycleLove for a number of months, I suddenly felt the urge to vent steam about my profession.</p>

<p>So I did.</p>

<p>And was bowled over by the response.</p>

<p>The old James wouldn’t have dared to be so honest about his feelings online. (Especially not when he had a boss who might find out).</p>

<p>But the new James was lost, angry, and sick of holding it all in.</p>

<p>So I unleashed my feelings with words.</p>

<p>Pretty soon I saw people talking about what I’d written on Twitter:</p>
 
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>"How to stop being a graphic designer" - Inspirational blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/CycleLoveHQ">@CycleLoveHQ</a> ~ <a href="http://t.co/kG4D72X9">http://t.co/kG4D72X9</a></p>— Gavin Strange (@JamFactory) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamFactory/status/278106242281504771">December 10, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 
<p>This positive feedback was only half the story, as what I'd written had—of course—ruffled the feathers of quite a few graphic designers. </p>
 
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Madedigital">@Madedigital</a> maybe stop being such a whiny little bitch and grow a pair</p>— Dominic Burt (@Humanhair) <a href="https://twitter.com/Humanhair/status/376029982533115904">September 6, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 
<p>Seeing people talk about me like this was an alien feeling. It sat uneasily in the pit of my stomach for a few months.</p>

<p>Then I realised something:</p>

<p><strong>If you want to be magnetic, you must be willing to repel as many people as you attract.</strong></p>

<p>It’s simple physics really.</p>

<p>Magnetism is a push AND a pull.</p>

<p>For every person who thinks ‘Yes! This is for me’, there will be another thinking ‘Uh-uh! No thanks’. </p>

<p>To build a following for your art, you must be willing to embrace your unsubscribes, your do-not-likes and your haters. Each one is an endorsement that what you're doing matters.</p>

<h1 id="beingwrongisonlythefirststep">Being wrong is only the first step</h1>

<p>Looking back, what I wrote about quitting design was quite naive, and I’ve already posted a ‘<a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2013/8/how-to-stop-being-a-graphic-designer-redux">redux</a>’ article in which I elaborated on my thoughts, and another about <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/9/hate-being-a-graphic-designer">your full-time job being an escape route</a>, not a trap.</p>

<p>But I’m glad that I gave myself permission to write that first angry blog post. It opened up doors for me, helped me connect with a whole new audience.</p>

<p>I've realised that taking a stand like this is sometimes the only way to make sense of your thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I feel I change my mind all the time. And I sort of feel that's your responsibility as a person, as a human being – to constantly be updating your positions on as many things as possible. And if you don't contradict yourself on a regular basis, then you're not thinking.” <br>
  ― Malcolm Gladwell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why am I telling you all of this?</p>

<p>The internet seems to be overflowing with content that’s low in nutritional value for the soul. </p>

<p>And it's drowning out the good stuff.</p>

<p><strong>The web—and the world—needs more you.</strong></p>

<p>Be open.</p>

<p>Be authentic.</p>

<p>Be vulnerable.</p>

<p>And above all else….</p>

<h2 id="giveyourselfpermission">Give yourself permission</h2>

<p>Instead of stopping to ask if it's 'ok' before you do say something, go ahead and do it. </p>

<p>I know it's scary, but you can try it on a tiny scale to begin with, and then scale up as your confidence expands.</p>

<p>Whatever happens, reserve the right to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change your mind </li>
<li><a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2015/1/weird-and-twisted-and-drowning">Get it wrong </a></li>
<li>Give a fuck </li>
<li><a href="http://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck">Not give a fuck</a> </li>
<li>Get lost </li>
<li><a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2013/8/feeling-lost-relax-youre-probably-headed-in-the-right-direction">Feel lost</a> </li>
<li>Be lazy </li>
<li><a href="http://greig.cc/journal/your-mind-is-a-jail-built-out-of-bullshit">Be honest</a> </li>
<li>Be yourself</li>
<li><a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2013/8/how-to-stop-being-a-graphic-designer-redux">Completely ignore all of the above</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the only mistake you can make is not starting.</p>
