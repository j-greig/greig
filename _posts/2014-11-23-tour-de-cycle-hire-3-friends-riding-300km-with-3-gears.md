<![CDATA[<p>When my friend Graham at <a href="http://borough.cc/">Borough</a> came up with the idea to ride Boris Bikes from London to Paris, I jumped at the chance to join him.</p><p>The plan was to take cameras with us so we could photograph the ride ourselves, but when director Chris Lawson got in touch to say that he wanted to travel with us and shoot a film, we could hardly say no. (Despite the fact that we hadn't done any training or even planned a proper route).</p><p><a href="http://www.cyclelove.cc/2014/11/in-photos-a-tour-de-cycle-hire-adventure-from-london-to-paris/">Head over to CycleLove to see my photographs from the trip,</a> or hit play below to see how the journey panned out on film.</p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Z19ztrJhiLI?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">
