<p>When a track sends a shiver down your spine in the first few seconds of listening, it's generally a sign that you're onto something good.&nbsp;</p><p>But sharing discoveries on social media sometimes feels like flushing them down the toilet, so I'm going to start posting some of my favourite things here instead, starting with this music video by <a href="http://sohnmusic.com/">S O H N</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The Wheel" was released in 2012 but thanks to inclusion&nbsp;<a href="http://www.factmag.com/2013/06/17/fact-mix-387-dj-koze/">on a DJ Koze mix</a> has been popping up all over the place this year. Which I'm grateful for, because up until today I'd missed this track completely.</p><p>Update: just realised there's&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/sohnmusic/disclosure-help-me-lose-my">a S O H N remix of Disclosure's "Help Me Lose My Mind"</a>. Holy shit.</p>
