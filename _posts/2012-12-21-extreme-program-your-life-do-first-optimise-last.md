<p>Working as a digital designer (and&nbsp;amateur&nbsp;programmer) in Scotland I was briefly exposed (1) to the software development methodology of '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming" data-link-type="external">extreme programming</a>', whose creator Kent Beck advocated coding first, and optimising last.</p><p>His aim was to allow for more iterations in the development cycle of a piece of software, thus creating the most&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;for feedback and improvement. Tellingly perhaps, his third book on the subject was called "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change".</p><p>By swapping out the 'coding' for 'doing', his&nbsp;approach can be used to engineer greater, and faster, change in your own personal development.</p><p>Do first, optimise last (and embrace the change).</p><hr /><p>(1) Hat tip to my former, and slightly maverick, boss&nbsp;<a href="http://hossgifford.com/" data-link-type="external">Hoss Gifford</a>.&nbsp;I still the remember the day our team got a bollocking for animating a 'wrong password' shake on the login screen of our fledging email newsletter system, whilst the rest of it remained completely unbuilt (which is how it remains to this day).</p>
