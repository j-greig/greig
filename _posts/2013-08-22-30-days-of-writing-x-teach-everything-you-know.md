<p>Enough is enough.</p><p>I'm calling time on my self-induced self-helping self-discovery gluttony.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">After almost two years of reading endless self-help books and self-development blogs, I've consumed the opinions of hundreds of writers.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>Now it's time to reverse the flow of information.</p><p>Who am I? How can I help you? W<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">hat should I write about?</span></p><p>Well, I'm not entirely sure.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">So I'm setting myself a writing challenge mashup:</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"> "30 days of writing"</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;x "Teach everything you know"</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">(Inspired by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://medium.com/i-dont-know-a-thing" style="line-height: 1.6em;">Paul Jarvis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://nathanbarry.com/89697-reasons-to-teach/" style="line-height: 1.6em;">Nathan Barry</a>&nbsp;respectively).</p><h2>Starting tomorrow, I'm going to write 1,000 words a day on a topic I've acquired some kind of knowledge about, for 30 days in a row.</h2><p>Usually I dream up these kinds of crazy ideas and then bail out.</p><p>I<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;came up with this particular one early yesterday morning and spent today compiling a list of excuses not to do it: I'm in debt, I need to concentrate on selling my flat, I need a break at weekends, I need all my energy to do freelance gigs,</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://unicornfree.com/2013/the-harsh-truth-about-fear" style="line-height: 1.6em;">I'm afraid</a>...<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;shit... maybe&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I don't even have anything useful to teach people.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"></span></p><p>Bullshit, James.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">This time it's going to be different.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Just to make sure — on any day where I don't write 1,000 words about something I know before midnight, I will donate £100 to <a href="http://www.re-cycle.org/">charity</a>.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I've already written a list of 20 possible topics to cover.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Everything from electronic music production to designing and building Wordpress themes to climbing mountains on bicycles.</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">If half of them are usable then I only need another 20 to make it through to the end of the challenge.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I think I can do this.</span></p><p>Ok.</p><p>I'm going to hit the 'publish' button now.&nbsp;</p><p>See you tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that, and...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
