<p>There’s a box under my desk, about the size of a large crate of wine, which is full of cables. A lifetime of cables in fact, from USB to LAN to MIDI.</p><p>I should probably throw some of them away… but you never know when a 3.5mm to twin phono extension is going to come in useful, do you?</p>

<p>Here's my problem...</p>

<p>No matter how carefully I put the cables into the box, they always end up tangled.</p>

<p>A clusterfuck of cables.</p>

<p>The science says that if you take enough long, slim objects, and enough contact points, it’s almost impossible for them NOT to get tangled. </p>

<hr>

<p>Something similar happens when you mix together procrastination with guilt.</p>

<p>Here’s an example: I’ve thought about writing every Sunday for the last five months, but not once made it to my keyboard.</p>

<p>Which is weird because for the first half of this year, writing wasn’t a problem. I’d simply told myself that it was something I did once a week, and sat down to do it.</p>

<p>Accountability is a technique I’ve used before to make myself <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/10/writing-1000-words-daily-accountability-hack">write 1,00 words a day</a>.</p>

<p>In the long run though, accountability is not a sustainable approach. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Untangling clusterfuck cable 1: Accountability is like paying a kid to do his homework. It gets things done, but not for the right reasons. You can’t force yourself to do things.</strong></p>

<p>I’ve also been feeling guilty for not writing.</p>

<p>My Freelancer’s Field Manual got put on hold before the first chapter was finished. And then, in painfully ironic fashion, a full-time freelance gig seemed to zap what was left of my energy.</p>

<p>The only thing increasing in strength was the guilt.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Maybe you have a pair of running trainers at the back of a cupboard somewhere, or a musical instrument gathering dust. And just thinking about the fact makes the guilt stronger. So you try to bury it inside you. Which only makes it worse.</p>

<p>Go easy on yourself my friend.</p>

<p>Everyone procrastinates. Everyone tries to start a new habit and gets stuck.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Untangling clusterfuck cable 2: Feeling guilty about not doing something is a vicious circle. To break out of it, take a step back and observe the situation. Breath.</strong></p>

<p>I tried all kinds of things to snap myself back into writing . I read (half of) a book about exercising my demons, lots of books about the art of writing itself, and breaking my work down into 25 minute Pomodoros. None of which made much difference.</p>

<p>All I really needed to do was to write.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Untangling clusterfuck cable 3: You’re perfect how you are. You don’t need any more tools or books or techniques to get things done.</strong></p>

<p>It’s time to stop reading about how other people do things (yes that includes me) and figure things out for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/1/i-never-finish-anyth">Start with something tiny. Spend five minutes working on it. Repeat.</a></p>

<p>Good. The tangle of cables is looking less scary now.</p>

<p>But there’s still one big knot to tackle…</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Untangling clusterfuck cable 4: Remember your why.</strong></p>

<p>What’s driving you to do the work you do? Who are you helping? What are you trying to fix in the world?</p>

<p>I write because it helps me think more clearly. But more than that, my work as a writer feels like it has meaning, in a way that my work as a designer never quite has done. I write because it seems to help other people, not just me.</p>

<p>Of all the things I'd forgotten, my original motivation was the most crucial. </p>

<p>Find purpose in your work, and hold on tight to it.</p>
