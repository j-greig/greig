<p>If you&nbsp;over-think your article's headline, there's a danger you might forget the importance of what comes next â€” the opening sentence. (Note to self: you need to brush up on this also).</p><p>Thankfully <a href="http://asserttrue.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/how-to-write-opening-sentence.html">Kat Thomas has compiled a useful list</a> of ways to avoid entrapment in cliche:</p><ul><li>Simply tell the reader what the subject is.</li><li>Make a blunt statement.</li><li>Cite a statistic.</li><li>Tell a first-person anecdote that's relevant to the subject.</li><li>Tell a third-person anecdote.</li><li>Put up a straw man, then knock it down.</li><li>Summarize a current state of affairs (or the conventional wisdom), then tell what's changed.</li><li>Summarize previous research, then tell what new research has found.</li><li>Involve the reader in a bit of conjecture.</li><li>Start with a quotation from a famous figure. (But beware of triteness.)</li><li>Commit an egregious exaggeration. Then explain what the (less extreme) reality is.</li></ul><p></p>
