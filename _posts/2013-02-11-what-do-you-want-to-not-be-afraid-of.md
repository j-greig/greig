    <span>&#8220;</span>We’re in the richest, best educated, most spectacular moment in the history of the world and we’ve got nothing to be afraid of. There are no saber tooth tigers left. I mean one day the world is going to melt and that’s not going to matter. Between now and tomorrow, the question is where is your fear and how are you going to use it as opposed to hide from it.<span>&#8221;</span>

I don't like the sound of my own voice. I've spent over a decade producing music but somehow that has made me even more reluctant to release my songs into the world. Which, it goes without saying, is pretty fucking stupid.</p><p>I'm afraid of interviewing the people I have lined up <a href="http://greig.cc/undesign/">for my ebook</a>. What if I ask them dumb questions? What if the interview goes down like a lead balloon?</p><p>I'm uneasy about broadcasting my most honest of opinions on the internet. Probably because I've labelled myself as the 'shy' type for much of my life. (I'm working on this).&nbsp;</p><p>I'm most definitely afraid of speaking in public (although I did recently&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cyclelove.cc/2013/01/in-photos-cycleloves-1st-birthday-bash-in-aid-of-cyclists-fighting-cancer/cl_1st_birthday_23/">speak to a room full of people using a microphone for the first time</a>).&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>What do you want to *not* be afraid of?</p>
