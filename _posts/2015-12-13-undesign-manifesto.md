<p>As this blog has just turned three, I wanted to compile a list of some of the lessons I've learnt since it started. (And since I became self-employed back in the spring of 2012).</p>

<p>Some are scrawled onto post-it notes stuck around my bedroom, some live in an email pep-talk thread that I send backwards and forwards to myself, and some are elaborated on elsewhere on this website.</p>

<p>The only common thread is that I've learnt all of these things from practical—and sometimes painful—experience.</p>

<p>How do you keep your sanity as a creative person? How do you figure out which is the work that matters? What propels you forward when it feels like the whole world is against you?</p>

<p>Share your thoughts with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%23undesignmanifesto&amp;src=typd">#undesignmanifesto</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1youarenotyourwork">1. You are not your work.</h2>

<p>Don't mistake criticism of <em>what you do</em> as criticism of <em>who you are</em>.</p>

<h2 id="2maketimetowrite">2. Make time to write.</h2>

<p>It gets the gunk out of your brain, and makes you smarter. </p>

<h2 id="3itsoktofeellost">3. It’s ok to feel lost.</h2>

<p>In fact it’s quite normal if you’re forging your own path. <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2013/8/feeling-lost-relax-youre-probably-headed-in-the-right-direction">Read more</a></p>

<h2 id="4youwillneverbeready">4. You will never be ready.</h2>

<p>And there will never be a ‘right’ time to start. Take a leap of faith. <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2013/6/you-will-never-be-ready">Read more</a></p>

<h2 id="5tobemagneticyoumustbewillingtorepelasmanypeopleasyouattract">5. To be magnetic, you must be willing to repel as many people as you attract.</h2>

<p>Or in other words: it’s <em>good</em> to have haters, because it means you have lovers too.</p>

<h2 id="6sometimesyouhavetosayfuckitanddosomethingforyourselfnomatterwhateveryoneelsethinks">6. Sometimes you have to say ‘fuck it’ and do something for yourself, no matter what everyone else thinks.</h2>

<p>If in doubt, trust your gut. You don't need permission. <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2015/4/on-giving-yourself-permission">Read more</a></p>

<h2 id="7dontmakeitperfectjustmakeitnow">7. Don’t make it perfect, just make it, now!</h2>

<p>Ignore the voice inside your head saying 'it's not good enough' and carry on regardless. </p>

<p>These words aren't intended as silver bullets. They won't change your life overnight. And what's worked for me might not work for you.</p>

<p>So if nothing else, I've written this list in the hope that you might write your own.</p>

<p>Here's the thing.</p>

<p>Of all the life changes I've written about over the past three years, the most transformative has been the writing itself.</p>

<p>Writing creates an amazing feedback loop which enhances everything you do. It clears the gunk out of your brain, and makes you smarter.</p>

<p>If you only take one piece of advice from me today (or ever), let it simply be: make time to write. </p>

<hr>

<p>If you want people to hear about your business, you should write.</p>

<p>If you care about sharing and improving ideas, you should write.</p>

<p>And above all…</p>

<p>If you want to find your voice, and to understand yourself, you should write.</p>
