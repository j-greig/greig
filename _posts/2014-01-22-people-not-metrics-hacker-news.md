Please excuse the humblebrag/linkbait headline that's gotten you here. Not bad huh? Keep reading though, because I have ulterior motives other than patting myself on the back.&nbsp;

Let's rewind to last week.

I'd had this "I never finish anyth" postcard up on my wall for a while, and it must have sunk in, because I woke up with a rare urge to write, and out flowed <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/1/i-never-finish-anyth">an article about finishing things</a>.

The headline seemed pretty catchy (hat tip to the artist <a href="http://wecreatestudio.co.uk/">Brad Rose</a>&nbsp;for that) so I decided <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7075537">to post it to Hacker News</a>.

Whilst there are <a href="http://alexstechthoughts.com/post/29406022580/how-to-get-on-the-frontpage-of-hacker-news">ill-advised ways to game the system</a>, the best way to get to the top of the Hacker News pile is simply to write good, honest content. Just as it is with most writing; I've found that trying to tell stories, rather than simply writing 'articles', usually yields the best results. Whilst that might sound pretty obvious, it took me a while to realise it.

I've had pretty mixed results with posting links to Hacker News in the past, with my story about <a href="http://www.cyclelove.cc/2012/11/why-i-cycled-a-hundred-miles-to-meet-my-first-customer/">cycling 100 miles to meet my first customer</a> being the only article to get real traction.&nbsp;

So as I watched my latest submission sliding down the "New" page, I wasn't holding out much hope. But then it picked up an upvote or two, and then a few more, and suddenly boom, there it was on the front page.&nbsp;

At this point all pretensions of ignoring&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/30/vanity-metrics/">vanity metrics</a>&nbsp;went out the window and I logged into Google Analytics for a live view of the traffic. If you've done this before for a site launch you'll know the buzz you get as the little bars march across the screen and the visitor count jumps up and down...

<pre><code>  &lt;img src="" alt=""/&gt;
</code></pre>

Pretty exciting stuff, given that my average number of visitors for a single day is currently around 300 people.

It didn't stop there, because the next day "<a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/1/i-never-finish-anyth">I never finish anyth</a>" was still hovering around the number 10 spot of Hacker News, and clocking up a decent number of hits via Reddit as well.

<strong>Total views for the first day in the life of the article: 25,000.</strong>

Not bad at all, considering that it usually takes me around six months to clock up that many page views.

Here comes the but...</p>

<h2>People matter more than metrics</h2>

Unless you're content farming or a Googlebot, page views don't matter. Likes don't matter. Tweets don't matter. They're just indicators that you're on the right track.&nbsp;

<strong>What matters is helping people. Adding real value. Inspiring people to do stuff.</strong>

In the end, I got more satisfaction from another metric (with a count of 1) than I did from all those thousands of page views.

Searching through my referral stats on Monday I found a chunk of traffic <a href="http://totalink.co.uk/beta-release">coming from a blog post</a>&nbsp;somewhere. It turns out that a guy called <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathandey">Jonathan</a> been inspired to&nbsp;<a href="http://totalink.co.uk/">launch the API</a> he'd been working on:

<blockquote>After reading 'I never finish anyth' I felt inspired to go back to what I'd started partway through last year and finish it. I always intended it to be a quick project but never got around to finishing it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which in a nutshell, is why I write.

Because there's a chance that somewhere down the line, the words that come out of me (however painful a process it might be) could change someone else's day for the better.

<strong>And that feels like magic to me.</strong>

If there's a moral to this story, it might look a little like this:
 
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">SEO is bullshit.
HEO is what you need.
Human Emotion Optimisation.
(If that isn't already a thing, I am hereby declaring it one).

<h2>Thinking about writing?</h2>

Stop thinking about it and give it a shot.

Write little and often.

<a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3016916/creation-stories/ricky-gervais-tells-a-story-about-how-he-learned-to-write">Write about what you know.</a>

Write more honestly than you feel comfortable with.

You might be surprised by what happens...
