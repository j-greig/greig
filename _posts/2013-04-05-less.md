<p>I stopped reading the news on a daily basis over a year ago. Newspapers have become a luxury reserved for killing time on long journeys. My TV is also long gone.</p><p>I've been trying to be more honest, mostly with myself. Less concerned with the gloss and sheen, the smoke and the mirrors of design.&nbsp;Less hung up on what other people think about me. My online dating profile now includes a paragraph about all the good and not-so-good stuff that happened to me last year, instead of a single sentence. Being truthful as often as possible (but never when it could hurt someone) feels refreshing.&nbsp;</p><p>But, I'm writing this with eighteen browser tabs open. I turned the honesty up a notch too far with my family and wish I hadn't. If you're reading this, I still love you Mum/Dad/sister/brother. I just had to hire a van to move flat. Most of the boxes are still sitting unopened in a spare room. Books and CDs that I haven't made use of in years, but still lug around with all my emotional baggage.</p><p>Which prompted this list of the things I'd like less of in my life.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.bulletproofexec.com/start-the-bulletproof-diet/" style="line-height: 1.6em;">Less sugar, gluten, grains and synthetic foodstuffs</a><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">.</span><br></p><p><a href="http://www.radicalhonesty.com/">Less lying to yourself, and other people.</a></p><p><a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/what-multitasking-does-to-our-brains">Less browser tabs.</a></p><p><a href="http://www.getaddictedto.com/stefan-sagmeister-interview/">Less complaining.</a></p><p><a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/">Less obligations.</a></p><p><a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Meetings_Are_Toxic.php">Less meetings</a><span>.</span></p><p><a href="http://zenhabits.net/no-goal/">Less goals</a><span>.</span><br></p><p><a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2012/12/its-not-just-what-you-do-its-what-you-dont-do">Less news</a><span>.</span></p><p><a href="http://five.sentenc.es/">Less email</a>.<br></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/ef4772e3c628">L</a><a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/ef4772e3c628">ess work</a><span>.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">Less stuff</a><span>.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/ten-reasons-to-watch-less-television/">Less TV.</a></p><p><a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2013/04/less/">Less.</a><br></p><p>L</p><p>e</p><p>s</p><p>s</p><p>.</p><p></p>
