<p>Reading <a href="http://www.toiletpaperentrepreneur.com/the-right-actions/44-ways-how-to-find-a-mentor/">this insanely long article on how to find a mentor</a>, I felt bamboozled by the variety of possible ways to reach out to people.</p><p></p><p>So instead, I decided to email the expert team of bloggers at&nbsp;<a href="http://fizzle.co/">Fizzle</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.pocketchanged.com/">Caleb Wojcik</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://thinktraffic.net/">Corbett Barr</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://icetothebrim.com/">Chase Reeves</a>) for their thoughts on finding "the one".</p><p>Here's what they came back with:</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#8220;</span>I don’t believe you need a formal mentor to succeed. In fact, of all the successful people I know, I don’t know any who had a specifically identified ‘mentor’.<span>&#8221;</span>
  </blockquote>

</figure><p>Say what?&nbsp;Successful&nbsp;people don't have mentors?</p><p>Hmpfffff. This isn't helping guys!<br></p><p>I can haz mentor? Plz?<br></p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#8220;</span>One thought: DON’T ask them if they’d ‘like to be your mentor.’ <span>&#8221;</span>
  </blockquote>

</figure><p>Access denied. Again!</p><p>If I don't find a mentor, how will I get the help I need?<br></p><p>Who are these guys anyway? Why do all their names start with C? Maybe it's some kind of weird cult...</p><p>Ok ok... yes... &nbsp;I'm deliberately spinning this out a little.&nbsp;</p><p>Time to recap on their emails, without editing deliberately editing out the useful parts this time ;)</p><p></p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#8220;</span> I think there are 3 kinds of people you need to be around:<br/><br/>1) People further along<br/>2) People on your level (this would be the small circle or “mastermind group” idea)<br/>3) People where you used to be (these people will usually find you)<span>&#8221;</span>

</figure><p>Ah, ok, I see where this is going now.</p><p>Helping other people can help me too?</p><p>That makes sense.</p><p>In fact, Caleb's advice has already had me rethinking my inbox karma.</p><p>I've been receiving a handful of emails each week via CycleLove, from people in search of advice on their design or blogging projects.</p><p>Most of which I have ignored, or written terse replies to.</p><p>D'oh.</p><p>Rest assured, I will be making a&nbsp;conscious&nbsp;effort to respond more helpfully to these kinds of enquiries from now on. (This is something which startup founders like Joel Gascoigne make a point of <a href="http://joel.is/startup-help">time-tabling into their weekly routine</a>).</p><p>Corbett's email went on to explain that most of the&nbsp;successful&nbsp;people he knows had "informal connections with several people who were further along in the journey".</p><p>This seems like a great tip too — why have a single source of advice when you can have several?</p><p>Corbett also pointed out that "asking someone outright to be your mentor might work, or it could be awkward".&nbsp;</p><p>But fear not... because Chase suggested a subtle way around this, namely to "ask for a 20m conversation or two a month" instead of a full-on mentorship.</p><p>At this point, pause for a moment, and put yourself in the shoes position of the guru you'd been thinking of approaching.</p><p> This dude, or dudette, will undoubtably be even busier than you are (but hopefully also &nbsp;<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/">be smart enough not to describe themselves as busy</a>).</p><p>Will said potential mentor want to commit to a long-term relationship with someone who's just pinged them an overly eager email?</p><p>Probably not, is the likely answer. </p><p>Chase's advice already had this covered though.</p><p>"At first you may want to just have one conversation where you have a specific question or two. Then end that with: 'Would you mind if I called you in a month or so to go over what i've done about this stuff?'".</p><p>This sounds a lot more palatable for the mentor in question. And it would give you a chance to establish a genuine rapport before getting serious about the relationship.</p><p>So, do you really need a mentor?</p><p>I'm starting to think the answer is... perhaps not.</p>
