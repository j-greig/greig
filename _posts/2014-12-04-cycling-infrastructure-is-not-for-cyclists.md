Yesterday <a href="http://www.lfgss.com/conversations/259098">I took a LOT of flack for airing my view that dedicated cycling infrastructure would get more people cycling in London</a>, and be safer than people on bikes sharing the road with traffic.

Granted, it was on a forum for fixed gear riders — "<a href="http://www.copenhagenize.com/2010/07/vehicular-cyclists-secret-sect.html">vehicular cyclists</a>" — who love riding in traffic, so probably the most hostile place possible to argue my case.

But I'm glad I did, because it's opened my eyes to some very skewed perceptions about cycle lanes. Here are just a few of the replies to my forum post:

<blockquote>
  Enforced segregation of cyclists on major roads will increase driver aggression towards cyclists who choose not to use the cycle lanes, I have experienced this first hand, and often.
</blockquote>

I don't think drivers could get any more aggressive than they already are in London. Maybe it's worth taking a punt on this...

<blockquote>
  Look, @cyclelove, most of us know how to, and are completely competent to cycle on the road and share it with motorists every day in a safe and efficient manner. Please, don't fuck it up for us.
</blockquote>

So we should maintain the status quo because the minority of people already cycling are happy as they are? This seems just a tad selfish to me.

<blockquote>
  Cycling here [London] is wonderful. It really is. Just get into it, and forget the main roads.
</blockquote>

Um, why should bikes be treated as a second class mode of transport?

<blockquote>
  This isn't a build it and they will come type of deal
</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2011_columbus_assessment.pdf">Evidence from New York (and countless other cities) suggests otherwise:</a>:

"After New York City installed a protected bike lane on Columbus Avenue, bicycling increased 56 percent on weekdays, crashes decreased 34 percent, speeding decreased, sidewalk riding decreased, traffic flow remained similar, and commercial loading hours/space increased 475 percent"

<blockquote>
  No cycle infrastructure is as straightforward, as easy to use, direct, or unfrustrating as riding as other traffic, taking the lane. All cycle paths are made rubbish, basically.
</blockquote>

I'd agree that many cycle paths in the UK are deficent, or worse still, outright dangerous. But that doesn't mean that they have to stay that way...

Reading these (and many even more ridiculous comments) I thought I was losing my sanity. Until, thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/aseasyasriding/status/540138264028790784">people on Twitter reminded me otherwise</a>.

<strong>Somehow the UK has been swayed by outdated research (all from before 1990) that cycle lanes are dangerous, whilst the rest of the world has started building them and reaping the benefits.</strong>

I don't want to stop people cycling on roads. (And I quite enjoy mixing it up with traffic, some of the time).

If people want to ride their bikes at speed in the main road, like a motor vehicle, they should be allowed to do so. Having more cycle lanes doesn't mean cramping  vehicular cyclist's style.

But the issue of cycle lanes isn't about me, or people who've been cycling for years on UK roads and gotten used to 'taking the lane'.

This is about the people who aren't cycling yet...

<h2 id="segregatedcyclelanesarentneededforcycliststheyreneededforallthepeoplewhowanttocyclebutdontbecauseitsunsafe">Segregated cycle lanes aren't needed for 'cyclists'. They're needed for all the people who want to cycle but don't because it's unsafe.</h2>

<blockquote>
  How many Citizen Cyclists could have had their lives extended by being provided with safe infrastructure, or lived a life with fewer illnesses? How many overweight people could have had the chance to cycle happily to work on bike lanes and keep fit? The number of potential daily cyclists who have been restricted access to the bicycle must number in the tens of millions. All because of the ideology of a self-serving group.
</blockquote>

Meanwhile, forward-thinking cities are being made more liveable by investing (not 'spending') money on protected cycling infrastructure.

It's happening in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden; in Dublin, Portland, New York, Philadelphia.

Yes, people riding bikes should take training if they need it, so they feel confident in riding in traffic.

Yes, cycle lanes aren't a magic pill that will fix everything overnight. (The culture of road use in the UK needs to change also).

Yes, we should invest in public transport as well.

And yes, we should invest in 'quietways' so that people can cycle safely through local neighbourhoods.

But...

No, <a href="https://aseasyasridingabike.wordpress.com/2013/12/31/not-dangerous/">cycling isn't dangerous</a>. (It's UK road design that is).

And no, most definitely no, <a href="http://road.cc/content/news/94378-nice-way-code-shuts-shop-gets-lambasted-self-congratulatory-farewell-message">asking drivers to "be nice to people on bikes" is not the solution</a>.

<h2 id="peopleonbikesshouldntbetreatedlikesecondclasscitizensonourroads">People on bikes shouldn't be treated like second class citizens on our roads.</h2>

Britain's old-fashioned obsession with cars is holding us back, and the stats on how we make short journeys paint a depressing picture:

<blockquote>
  For all British trips under 2 miles (around ten minutes by bike), 39% are driven, 2% are cycled.
  — <a href="https://twitter.com/aseasyasriding/status/540090190745075712">@aseasyasriding</a>
</blockquote>

There is another way. And it's not cycling-pie-in-the-sky. Scores of other countries have already shown that cycling can be a mainstream mode of transport if there is the ncessary political willpower to make it happen.

People on bikes shouldn't be forced to take meandering back routes to get from A to B safely.

People on bikes shouldn't be denied cycle lanes because our streets are 'too narrow'. There's plenty of room for everyone — including people on foot — once motor vehicles are no longer made the priority.

I want to live in a city where my kids can cycle to school safely.

Where everyone can ride a bike in safety, regardless of their age.

Where cycling is a normal, everyday, do-it-without-thinking activity, for young kids, teenagers, men, women, parents, grandparents, everyone.

Let's look to the future, to how things could be, instead of getting hung up on what's gone wrong in the past.

Cycle lanes can make life better for cyclists, for motorists, and for people who just want to ride their bikes.

Is that so crazy?
