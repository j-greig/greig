<![CDATA[<p>Solutions to the problem of writer's block are legion. The funny thing is that people don't often get stuck for words when mid conversation; words tend to just come out.</p><p><a href="http://kjablog.com/dictating-writing-hiking/">So Kevin Anderson's approach to writing (by not writing)</a> is ingenious:</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#8220;</span>If you see a person walking along engaged in a vigorous conversation with no one else around, it doesn’t necessarily mean he’s escaped from the nearest asylum.  It could be me talking to myself.  But don’t be concerned, don’t interrupt me, don’t bother me at all — I’m writing.<br/><br/>It’s been about fifteen years since I gave up the keyboard and took up a recorder for my first drafts.  Since that time, I’ve dictated nearly fifty novels on an innumerable number of microcassettes, speaking the words aloud, rather than typing them into my word processor.<span>&#8221;</span>
  </blockquote>
  
</figure><p>Storytelling originated as a spoken art form, so walking and talking isn't as crazy as it might sound.</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#8220;</span>Revered shamans would tell tales around the campfire, legends of monsters in the darkness or heroes who killed the biggest mammoth.  Homer did not write his epics down.  What could be more natural than speaking your novel aloud before committing the words to a computer hard drive or an editor’s red pencil?<span>&#8221;</span>
