# Coronavirus Lockdown Diary

## Day 1 — 16th March 2020

It’s 5am the morning after the UK government announced people should drastically reduce social contact because of Coronavirus Covid-19, and I have woken with a clear thought after a day of confusion: it is time to start writing again. I’m starting now because I don’t want to forget some of the things that happened yesterday.

I know that writing will help me make sense of what is going to be a crazy few months, and that one day I'll want to look back and read these posts, and maybe writing everything down will help me or someone else feel better.

One thing that’s not helping is the news — I can feel the anxiety ratcheting up as I watch, and it’s been hard to separate paranoid thoughts (“Is that sticky feeling in my throat the beginning of a dry cough?”) from reality. (“I am clearing my throat much more than usual”).  The rolling coverage is addictive, and I’m conscious that I need to wean myself off before it takes over.

When the news came out the first thing I did was call my parents, who were due to visit me from London this weekend. They’re in their late sixties, and in good health, but it’s hard not to feel concern about their health over anyone else in my family. We’d already spoken about a train not being the best place to spend time right now, so I’m glad the decision not to travel has been made for them officially now.

Yesterday at work the company plan was announced — “we don’t want you to work from home yet” — and I wasn’t too happy. We had a sobering reminder of how the last recession impacted the economy, and there was talk of hours being cut. I pointed out that we had decided to follow government advice the previous week, but that I wasn’t sure any more that this could be trusted given the UK seemed to be on a different path from our neighbours in Europe. It felt weird to have 10 people crammed into our wee meeting room, and the idea that we could somehow isolate the studio from the virus whilst still all coming and going… was clearly just wrong. I think the decision not to start working from home was driven by the perceived difficulty of a design studio all working remotely. Something we’re about to be thrown in the deep end on… at least while there is still work to do.

The new government advice was announced right at the end of the working day, and I’ve not heard any updates from work since, but I’m assuming we’ll all be working from home now.  In any case, I made an early morning trip to Ikea on Sunday to buy a huge desk, as I had a feeling I’d need it sooner rather than later. So at least my home office setup is fairly decent, apart from the lack of a proper chair.

What else to say just now?

It looks like it’s going to be just me and the cat for a while. (I’m not too worried about being isolated just yet, as I’ve gotten pretty good at that living alone the past few years). I’ll tell you about our routine another day, but for now let’s just say it starts with me getting a lick and my paws chewed.
