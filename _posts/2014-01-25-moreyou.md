<p>Whilst researching <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2014/1/a-z-startup-lingo">my last article</a>, I discovered that someone's written a book about <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00657QSVW?tag=greig-21">how to think like Steve Jobs</a>.</p><p>Which goes by the grand title of...<br /><br /><em>What Would Steve Jobs Do? How the Steve Jobs Way Can Inspire Anyone to Think Differently and Win.</em><br /><br />Now I have no intention of reading the book, so I can't tell you if it'll turn you into a parrot or a genius. (Although I'm guessing the former).</p><p>But one thing I do know is that modelling your life on someone else's is a crap idea.</p><p>Imagine how infuriating it would be to work at Apple if everyone kept asking "What would Steve do?". Maybe it's already happening there. Or at Microsoft. I don't know.<br /><br />So, don't try to be the next Steve Jobs. Or Bill Gates. Or whoever else is your hero.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Just try to be yourself.</strong><br /><br />Why?</p><ul><li>The world needs more you.</li><li>Answering the question "Who am I?" will open doors you didn't even know existed.</li><li>Because you're more interesting than you give yourself credit for.</li></ul><p><br />Now if I was in the US I would have simply written "Because you're awesome" for that last one. But it's one of those things that doesn't sound so great in a British accent, right?</p>
