It's only recently that I've discovered the wealth of articles and discussions on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" data-link-type="external">Hacker News</a>, the social news forum of the&nbsp;Silicon Valley&nbsp;startup&nbsp;incubator&nbsp;<a href="http://ycombinator.com/" data-link-type="external">Y Combinator</a>.</p><p>So when I posted my "<a href="http://www.cyclelove.cc/2012/11/why-i-cycled-a-hundred-miles-to-meet-my-first-customer/" data-link-type="external">100 mile bike courier</a>" story <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4796755" data-link-type="external">to the site</a>&nbsp;back in November, I&nbsp;didn't give it much thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the stats again now, I'm so glad that I took the decision to upgrade my hosting from Dreamhost (cheap, slow, slightly ropey) to <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=394686&amp;U=671335&amp;M=41388&amp;urllink=" data-link-type="external">WP-Engine</a> (moderately priced, fast, reliable), whose managed Wordpress hosting performed flawlessly.</p><p>Granted — 7,000 uniques in a day isn't a huge number for an established site, but for <a href="http://www.cyclelove.cc/" data-link-type="external">CycleLove</a> it represented a quantum leap in traffic — of almost 7,000%.</p>

<p>So, if you're serious about blogging, I'd strongly recommend you spend some time on&nbsp;<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.</p><p>To begin with, simply lurk on the site. Read the trending articles.&nbsp;Try too get a feel for which stories are popular... and then try submitting your own.</p><p>This seems to be something of a black art — <a href="http://hnpickup.appspot.com/" data-link-type="external">this tool</a> might help you work out the best time to make your post — which, as with most things online, requires you to work with the flow of US internet usage and time zones.</p><p><em>Also see: <a href="http://sparknlaunch.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/lessons-learned-from-a-hacker-news-spike/" data-link-type="external">Lessons learned from a Hacker News spike</a></em><a href="http://sparknlaunch.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/lessons-learned-from-a-hacker-news-spike/" data-link-type="external"></a></p><hr /><p>On a slight&nbsp;tangent&nbsp; I also wanted to share a couple of tweets with you from 'power' users on Twitter, each with a following equivalent to a large city.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/espiekermann" data-link-type="external">Erik Spikermann</a> is a renowned typographer/designer (and cyclist) with around 244K followers. I'm not sure how he heard about CycleLove, but nevertheless he did, even <a href="http://www.cyclelove.cc/2012/11/what-bike-do-you-ride/#comment-735851066" data-link-type="external">posting a photo of bis Berlin bike collection</a>&nbsp;to the site.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>If you love cycles, as I do, you’ll love <a href="http://t.co/D4bN4nyT" title="http://www.cyclelove.cc">cyclelove.cc</a></p>— erik spiekermann (@espiekermann) <a href="https://twitter.com/espiekermann/status/279538230192394240" data-datetime="2012-12-14T10:48:02+00:00">December 14, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>High-street&nbsp;fashion retailers <a href="https://twitter.com/Topshop/status/282086237832101889" data-link-type="external">Topshop</a> have a staggering 492K followers on Twitter, and posted this tweet about the <a href="http://www.cyclelove.cc/2012/12/a-very-velo-christmas/" data-link-type="external">Christmas Style Selection</a> which blogger <a href="http://velo-city-girl.blogspot.co.uk/" data-link-type="external">Lady Velo</a> compiled for CycleLove</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Christmas cycle style!

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>It's harder to asses the impact of these tweets as they happened right after the relaunch of the CycleLove site, but I can tell you that Erik's tweet in&nbsp;particular&nbsp;resulted in an instantaneous burst of sales on the CycleLove shop.</p><p>PS. Wondering how I got Topshop to tweet about CycleLove? I built <a href="http://insideout.topshop.com/" data-link-type="external">their blog </a>for them, a job which involved migrating 1,200 posts from TypePad to Wordpress. Not something I'd like to do again in a hurry (the migration process, that is).</p>
