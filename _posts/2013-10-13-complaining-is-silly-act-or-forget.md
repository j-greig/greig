There's usually an interval of a couple of minutes between me broadcasting a throwaway remark or snide comment on Twitter... and me deleting the tweet.

I'll see it nestled amongst the rest of my feed and realise that it's not adding any value for anyone. &nbsp;

So what if I had a shitty day, or if it's raining outside (again), or I got put on hold for 10 minutes and had to listen to panpipe renditions of Celine Dion's greatest hits?

The people following me on Twitter can't help with any of this.&nbsp;

Click. Delete. Gone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Let go of the bad vibes, dude...</h2>

I find it's far more productive to make a record of positive thoughts rather than grievances — things that I'm grateful for (<a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2013/8/10-kinds-of-writing">do this every day if you can</a>) or ideas for fixing something that's bugging me.

The title of this article is a quote from graphic designer <a href="http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/">Stefan Sagmeister</a> that's been floating around the internet for a few years now.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">It was originally the start of a diary entry about things which make him happy:</span>

<blockquote>Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.<br><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Thinking life will be better in the future is stupid. I have to live now.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Being not truthful works against me.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Helping other people helps me.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Organizing a charity group is surprisingly easy.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Everything I do always comes back to me.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Drugs feel great in the beginning and become a drag later on.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Over time I get used to everything and start taking it for granted.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Money does not make me happy.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Traveling alone is helpful for a new perspective on life.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Assuming is stifling.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Keeping a diary supports my personal development.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Trying to look good limits my life.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Worrying solves nothing.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Materia</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">l luxuries are best enjoyed in small doses.<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Having guts always works out for me.</span></blockquote>

If these sound like platitudes — which almost any list of this ilk does at face value — pick one of his ideas and test it out for yourself.&nbsp;

<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Sagmeister goes on to explain in his&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_shares_happy_design.html" style="line-height: 1.6em;">TED talk</a><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp; that many of the happiest moments in his life have been related to good design.&nbsp;</span><br>

What he's really saying, I think, is that you should apply the principles of good design to the way you live and think.&nbsp;

If something isn't working in your life, don't bitch about it.

<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Either pull it down and start again — or throw it away.</span>

PS. It's been raining here in London for most of the day. But&nbsp;<span>I</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ted.com/playlists/127/design_giants.html">just tweeted</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>a link to</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ted.com/playlists/127/design_giants.html">a playlist of TED talks by famous graphic designers</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>instead of complaining about the weather.</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp; And judging by the number of times it's been retweeted and saved already, I think I made the right call :)</span>
