<p><em>Try and ditch Photoshop and Illustrator if you’re making a web app. <a href="http://www.siteinspire.com/" data-link-type="external">siteInspire</a> is hardly a complex design but I didn’t touch either once apart from creating assets. Having no training in design, they feel like such old fashioned tools to me, and there’s a lot to be said for just diving in and creating everything in HTML and CSS from the outset.</em><br></p><p></p><p>Having been through a similarly exhausting redesign of CycleLove recently, I'd go a step further, and apply this principle to the design of pretty much any website.&nbsp;</p><p>Which reminds me of Jason Fried's number one reason to <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop" data-link-type="external">skip Photoshop</a>:</p><p></p><p><em>You can’t click a Photoshop mockup. They aren’t real. Paper isn’t real either, but paper doesn’t have that expectation. A Photoshop mockup is on your screen. If it’s on your screen it should work. You can’t pull down menus in a Photoshop mockup, you can’t enter text into a field in a Photoshop mockup, you can’t click a link in a Photoshop mockup. HTML/CSS, on the other hand, is the real experience.</em><br></p><p></p><div></div>
