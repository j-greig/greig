Remember the dulcet, gurgling tones of a 56K modem connecting over your phone line?

I can't think of a more evocative sound from my early online adventures.

Apart from an angry parent shouting "JAMESSSSSS! I NEED TO USE THE PHONEEEEEEE" from downstairs.<br>

It was 1999. The internet and I were fresh-faced. (9 and 18 years old respectively).

I'd graduated from Microsoft Frontpage. Macromedia Fireworks and Dreamweaver were my new toys, but I needed a reason to use them.

So I&nbsp;dreamt&nbsp;up a concept for my first website:

<blockquote>"Ever wondered what someone on the other side of the world looks like when they squash their face onto a scanner? Now's your chance to find out - Headscan brings hilarious images from across the globe direct to your desktop. Send us your picture and we will add it to the Scan Gallery, along with a dot marking you out on the map, and a link to your website".<br></blockquote>

By August 2000, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815095641/http://go.to/headscan">Headscan had clocked up&nbsp;14,000 hits</a>&nbsp;and was receiving around 15 submissions a month.<br>

My Hotmail inbox filled up with the names of exotic places.

Sheffield. Frankfurt. Manila. Rido de Janeiro. Alabama. Warsaw.

It felt like the future had arrived.

I made a prophetic&nbsp;declaration&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001102153325/http://www.shoestringdesign.co.uk/">on my fledgling&nbsp;web-design portfolio</a>:

<blockquote>"Thousands and thousands of new sites are launched every day. In ten years time nearly every business in Britain will be using the world wide web."</blockquote>

Hot damn, I was right!

But updating Headscan's static HTML was increasingly time-consuming. It would be another 4 years before I learnt PHP and mySQL, thanks to Wordpress.

I looked up the location of each submission in a <em>printed</em> atlas, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011214001657/http://www.shoestringdesign.co.uk/headscan/Maps/europe/europe.htm">then placed it by hand as a dot on the appropriate map</a>. You'll need to trust me on this, as the <a href="http://archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> is the only record of Headscan I have — an imageless ghost of what was my digital pride and joy.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

I distinctly remember the mixed emotions the first New Zealand Headscan heralded.

Wow! Someone on the other side of the world has heard about me!

(No MySpace, Facebook or Twitter remember. I guess people just emailed links to each other. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!msg/alt.music.world/wQ0bnsnR1DY/_47YURgminEJ">Or went on forums</a>. I even read the newspaper to find new sites).

D'oh! The marker dot is obliterating New Zealand on my map.

So&nbsp;I made a new map to house&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021119094355/http://www.shoestringdesign.co.uk/headscan/Maps/australia/majik.htm">Majik in Lower Hutt</a>&nbsp;and laboriously&nbsp;linked up the other locations.

This was starting to feel like hard work.

I was now studying graphics in Glasgow and had more pressing needs. Like earning extra cash to fund my social life and get drunk enough to think I could dance.&nbsp;

But I didn't own a computer.&nbsp;So I borrowed my flatmate's beige PC and once a week stayed up until dawn, cajoling pixels into place. I was hooked.&nbsp;

I stopped updating Headscan, and began cold-emailing businesses in the phone book that didn't have a website, offering to build one for £100. A car-hire company was the first to take up my offer. But that's a story for another day.&nbsp;

What did I learn from building my first website?&nbsp;

<ol><li>Experiment. Have fun. Put new skills into practice.</li><li>Don't worry about technology or writing beautiful code. 99.99999% of people don't care. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/453880/how-many-developers-are-there-in-the-world">The other 0.00001% will be arguing about what the actual percentage of people who do care is.</a></li><li>Build your site around people. Make it human.</li><li>Make a backup, dummy, or take screenshots. In a few hundred years someone <em>might</em> take the same pleasure from looking at your website as they do now looking at old black and white photos, marvelling at smudges of horse-drawn carts and petticoats.</li></ol>
