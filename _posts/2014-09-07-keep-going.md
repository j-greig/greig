The photo above <a data-cke-saved-href="http://instagram.com/p/sdID9WJ2v8/?modal=true" href="http://instagram.com/p/sdID9WJ2v8/?modal=true">was taken</a> in Devon last weekend.

I was staying <a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/somerset/streamcombe-farm/streamcombe-farm-shepherd-s-hut" href="http://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/somerset/streamcombe-farm/streamcombe-farm-shepherd-s-hut">in a tiny shepherd's hut</a> on a farm in Exmoor, nestled deep in a valley with no phone reception or internet.

(Being off grid was great of course, and since getting back I've taken steps to curb my social media addiction: starting with the deletion of the Facebook and Twitter apps from all my devices).

To get to the farm, you had to take a long and winding off-road track, the kind you get halfway up and then aren't sure if you're going the right way or not.</p>

Our own journeys through life can leave us feeling similarly lost.

Humans don't come with an instruction manual, and our lives don't come with a map. Which is why anyone who tells you they've got it all worked out is usually lying.

I'm a lot more comfortable with admitting this than I used to be: a lot of the time I have no idea where I'm going or what I want to do with my life.

And I've been grappling with both inertia and loneliness on and off over the past couple of years.

Depression, if you want to use a word that few people will use in public.

Long weekend afternoons spent wallowing on my bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to leave the house no matter how brightly the sun is shining.&nbsp;

So the sign caught my eye.

A timely reminder.

When you want to shut your eyes tight and curl up into a ball - don't.

Step outside your comfort zone. Try something different. Do something that scares you a little.

Whatever happens, like the sign says, KEEP GOING!!!
