<p>Recently I've noticed myself spending more time than I'm comfortable with on Twitter.</p>

<p>Even though I'm no longer tweeting from both the <a href="https://twitter.com/cyclelovehq">@cyclelovehq</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/j_greig">@j_greig</a> accounts, I'm still compulsively checking my feed when I'm on a computer or have a spare moment with my phone, and I don't like it.</p>

<p>Instead of moaning about my Twitter addiction on Twitter, I thought it would be interesting to swap public broadcasting for person-to-person communication.</p>

<p>So, over the next 4 weeks, you can <a href="http://greig.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=906a49eea090b21690d7c7375&amp;id=a636fb0c5e&amp;e=f13ed9b263">schedule a 20 minute call with me</a> most evenings, and during the day at weekends.</p>

<p>Whether you want to pick my brains about something you're working on, or simply chew the fat, it would be great to hear from you.</p>

<p>(Any tweets you see from me over this period will have been sent automatically via <a href="https://bufferapp.com/">Buffer</a>).</p>
