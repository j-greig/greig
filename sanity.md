## FAQS

**What's the difference between this book and How to Be a Graphic Designer without Losing Your Soul?**
[Adrian Shaughnessy's classic book][1] is a guide to the professional aspects of being a graphic designer, from setting up a studio to finding work. *How to be a Graphic Designer Without Losing Your Sanity* is intended to be a complimetary guide, about the personal wellbeing of graphic designers on an everyday basis.

**I'm in another creative field other than graphic design, is this book for me?**
Whilst much of the contents applies to other creative endeveours, it is very tailored to the specifics of being a graphic designer. But I would suggest reading [my blog][2] which is written to help all kinds of creative people get unstuck.
