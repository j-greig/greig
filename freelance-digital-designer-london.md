<h2><em>Based in London</em></h2>
Hello,

Since the summer of 2012, I've been working as a freelance graphic designer with various studios and agencies in London.

At heart I'm a digital specialist, but my background at Marque and Bureau for Visual Affairs has instilled me with a deep understanding of branding and its relationship with technology.

From strategy and prototyping to website and app design, I'm versed in the entire digital design workflow, and relish a challenge — whether that means working on my own, or as part of a project team.

If you landed directly on this page, <a href="/design-and-strategy">you can view my recent design work here</a>.

<h2>What it's like working with me</h2>
<blockquote><em>“James was great at taking feedback, delivered everything he promised on time and the standard of design was as high as I'd expected from his portfolio. Plus I learnt a lot myself from working with him. The end result was a really happy client and, personally, the most stress-free part of the rebrand.”</em>
— Adam Johnson, Design Director, Prophet</blockquote>
<blockquote>“<em>James is one of those rare but wonderful creative polymaths who is as comfortable setting beautiful typography as he is making music and writing code. His design shows a deep understanding of technology while holding its own with the pedants of the graphic design world</em>”
— Hoss Gifford, Director of Technology, OneMethod</blockquote>
